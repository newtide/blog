title: "My phone, a portal"
---

It was 3am and my eyelids were finally tired enough to close on their own. I turned off my phone and, for the first time in the whole day, was alone with my thoughts. In a few minutes, I would peacefully fall asleep. 
For the past few days I had this nagging feeling that I am not just addicted to phone, that there's something more to it. I knew I have been using my phone as a kind of escapism from something. And then I realized: I am afraid to be alone.

I don't put my phone on airplane mode, or even turn off the data for very long. Because if I do that the portal will close, and I will be alone in the room. As long as the portal is open I am with everyone. At any moment a notification will arrive and that will show someone's willingness in this planet earth to talk to me. And that'll lift my mood up somehow. I won't feel left out anymore.
